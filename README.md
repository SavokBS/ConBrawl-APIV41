# ConBrawl

- ConBrawl is private server that connects with BrawlStars API - BrawlStats

Just put your API token and TAG of player in Configuration.py, but player must have ALL 54 BRAWLERS or server will not work.

(If you can fix it, you are god.)

[Click here to download the server](https://github.com/crossfireTeam/conbrawl/files/7944076/ConBrawl-APIV41.zip)

[CLIENT, change ip in libmeow.js](https://www.mediafire.com/file/775ijd21sbsyb38/com.projectbsds.v41150.apk/file)

## Requirements: ##

This project is not serious. I just showed how you can combine the API and a private server to get an interesting result in the form of "presence" on the account of a popular personality in Brawl Stars
, so if you like this project, pls star
